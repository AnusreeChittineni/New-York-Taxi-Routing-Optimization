Be sure to have run files within data folder (follow readme within data folder) to create duckdb tables. 
Edit hotspotDBSCAN.py, train.py, pregnn.py to access tables location and shape file.

Run pregnn.py to set up data specifically for the collisionRisk training
Run hotspotDBSCAN.py to create dbscan clusters for collisionRisk input
Run train.py - this will use methods from dataloader.py, normalize.py, gcn.py to collect data, normalize it and train it using the gcn model.
  --- This will also print ROC, Confusion Matrix and PRC graphs to understand graph accuracy.
