Run pregnn.py to set up data specifically for the collisionRisk training
Run hotspotDBSCAN.py to create dbscan clusters for collisionRisk input
Run train.py - this will use methods from dataloader.py, normalize.py, gcn.py to collect data, normalize it and train it using the gcn model.
  --- This will also print ROC, Confusion Matrix and PRC graphs to understand graph accuracy.
